# Automate with code üìÉ
üè∑Ô∏è Automate some boring stuff using your favourite programming language. 

## How to contribute?
- Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
- Create the folder of your preferred language if not present and add your code within a folder or as a file.


## üöÄ Quick Start :

#### 1: Forking the repository :

Get your own local copy of the repository by clicking on `Fork` button at right upper corner.<br><br>

#### 2: Clone the Forked Repository

To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:
- Open the Command Prompt
- Type this command:
  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Automate-with-code
```

#### 3: Creating a new branch 
Branching helps managing your code and isolate your work. To create a new branch:
  
```bash
$ git branch <branch_name>
$ git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Keep your cloned repository upto to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### 4: Contribute
Commit your code in your branch using below steps:

First stage your changes,

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your code with appropriate message,

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

#### 5: Create Pull Request
Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the "Compare & pull request" button on the page.

GitHub will alert you that you can merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a title, a comment, and then press the ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù button.
